<h1>
  <span class="highlight">Hi, I'm <strong>Aiman.</strong></span> 
</h1>

<p>
  It wasn't until I started driving that I realized I wanted to pursue a career in <span class="highlight">Cybersecurity</span> in some regard. While driving, my brain instinctively seeks out the potential risks for each moment in time, as any slight imperfection could lead to harm. My situational awareness has trained me to mitigate as many risks as possible while driving. 
  Just as I minimize risks on the road, I'm driven by the same strategic awareness to defend the digital world, which aligns perfectly with the principles of <span class="highlight">Cybersecurity & Risk Management</span>.
</p>

<p>
  I'm currently working toward two Bachelor's degrees at The University of Texas at Dallas: <span class="highlight">Information Technology Systems </span> with a concentration in <span class="highlight">Cybersecurity Management</span> & <span class="highlight">Finance</span> with a concentration in <span class="highlight">Risk Management & Cybersecurity</span>.

<h2><span class="highlight">Vulnerability Scanner</h2>
<blockquote>
  I designed and deployed a scalable, full-stack application that allows users to initiate network scans through a web interface and see real-time results. I utilized AWS services including <span class="highlight">EC2</span> for hosting, <span class="highlight">S3</span> for frontend storage, and <span class="highlight">DynamoDB</span> for managing scan data.
  The scanner uses <span class="highlight">Nmap</span> to perform network scans asynchronously, detecting open ports and potential vulnerabilities. The backend consists of a <span class="highlight">Flask-based API</span> that is managed with <span class="highlight">Gunicorn & Nginx</span>.
  I also built and styled over eight dynamic HTML/CSS pages that use custom JavaScript routing, hosted through <span class="highlight">S3</span>. Throughout the project, I diagnosed and resolved numerous system-level issues, such as socket binding and Gunicorn daemon management errors, using Linux administration tools like <span class="highlight">lsof & systemctl</span>.
